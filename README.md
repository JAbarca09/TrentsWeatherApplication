# TrentsWeatherApplication
With the weather application the user can type any city in the world and by using a weather api we can retrieve that information and display it.
Here is the link to the weather application https://abarcajweatherapplication.azurewebsites.net/. 
Furthermore, the user should also be able to favorite cities, but I was unable to get this feature to work properly. Besides that, the weather application is not made to be responsive.
